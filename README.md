# PersonalWebsiteChatbotBackend

This is the backend for my personal website. To look at the repo with the frontend code, click (here)[https://github.com/srihariKrishnaswamy/personal-website]. This repo is basically just a 20-line, super basic flask server hooked up to a script that trains & runs a chatbot to answer questions about me.
