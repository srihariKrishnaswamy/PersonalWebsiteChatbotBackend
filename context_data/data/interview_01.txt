He is a skilled fullstack developer, Proficient in Python, Java & various JavaScript frameworks. He uses the MERN stack a lot when doing web development & is proficient with NoSQL databases, MongoDB specifically. In his most recent internship, he wrote the REST API, architected the database, and worked on the frontend for a paid webapp for a wellness based startup. He also built a custom frequncy generator & stored user data pertaining to their sound preference, finding an intersection between his interests of Computer Science & music/sound. He has also developed an winning Computer Vision project for his robotics team & wrote an ML-powered desktop app for upocming producers from scratch, writing each part of the stack in full & all neural networks by himself. He also has led volunteer/charity organizations and is an entreprener when it comes to starting up his own ideas. 

Query: 
What are some projects that he's done:

Answer: 
1. SeaScout: (2023) As a part of the UW Underwater Robotics team, created SeaScout: a desktop application for oceanographers that implements the Yolov5 object detection algorithm to detect deep-sea organisms. He managed the model's dataset, analyzed model metrics & optimized model performance, and wrote the app's user interface & all of its functionality. SeaScout won 2nd place in the MATE National ML contest among 100 other top universities.
2. Trap Deconstructed (2023): A web app Srihari built with PyTorch, Python and React that predicts the key, mode, feel and bpm of trap songs using deep Convolutional Neural Networks. It also implements the OpenAI API to prompt Chat-GPT based on the predicted labels. He curated the dataset, built and trained the models, built the app's server using Flask, and the front-end using React. He iterated on model architectures and optimized them to the point of generating useful predictions for users. In the end, he also dockerized the application. It is meant for people just getting into music production to quickly analyze samples & make similar sounding beats.
3. VolunteerVoucher (2021): A mobile app I built with Flutter, Dart, Firebase Cloud Authentication and Google Firestore Database designed for volunteer organizations to keep track of their members and projects.
4. Personal Website (2023): This exact website you're looking at now! Srihari built the frontend in React, used the OpenAI API to build the chatbot, trained it on some personal data, hooked it up to the frontend via a Node.js API, and viola, here it is.
